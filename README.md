# Yahtzee Probability Simulation & Analysis

This code simulates Yahtzee dice rolls and calculates probabilities for various outcomes. It lets users run multiple simulations, analyze the results, and compare them with theoretical probabilities.

## Features

- Simulate Yahtzee dice rolls and perform multiple simulations
- Calculate probabilities for various outcomes
- Analyze simulation results and compare with theoretical probabilities
- Gain insights into the likelihood of rolling different numbers of a kind

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/yahtzee-probability-simulation.git
   ```
   Make sure you have Git installed and configured on your command line.
2. Modify the `num_simulations` variable to specify the desired number of simulations.
3. Run the code to perform the simulations and calculate probabilities.
4. View the results, including the probabilities for different outcomes.
